      Nablus, a historic city in the northern West Bank, Palestine, is known for
      its rich cultural and historical significance. <br />
      Founded in 72 CE by the Romans, it has a long heritage reflected in its
      old markets, Ottoman-era architecture,<br />
      and soap-making industry. Nablus is also renowned for its sweet
      delicacies, particularly knafeh. <br />
      The city serves as an economic and cultural hub, and despite the
      challenges it has faced due to political tensions, <br />
      it remains a symbol of Palestinian resilience and tradition.
